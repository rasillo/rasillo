# Hi, I’m @rasillo

[Find me on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/rasillo.bsky.social)

🌱 I’m currently working on getting my Github repo started. It has been WAY too long without one. So this Github repo *will be quite empty* until I've actually put some stuff into it.

🪟 I spend a lot of time working inside a Windows enterprise environment, so that's my native environment.

🐧 But, I've spent well over a decade working in a variety of Linux distros professionally and as a hobby.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building the smallest, simplest, dumbest solutions possible; documenting them; and fixing odd problems in a variety of languages.

In rough order of how commonly I use a few common languages:
- Powershell
- Python
- Bash
- Rust

... do you think I put enough emojis into this README? :P
